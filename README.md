# CYO-project
final project for harvardX - data science

This repository includes all relevant files to exchange and grade the work done in the final project to receive a professional certificate in data science.

* Data file
* Code.R - code file
* Report.rmd - report markdown file
* Report.pdf - knitted final report file


The run time of the models is quite long although the data set has been reduced already. A computer with 32 GB of RAM has been used so the code might cause problems on computers with lower specifications. 

The RMD should run though, as the predictions and models have been saved and will be downloaded automatically while knitting the pdf.
